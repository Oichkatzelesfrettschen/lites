# lites

lites is a 4.4 bsd based mach server

this is a random collection of stuff

a lot of it was old 20 years ago

things keep falling off the network

somebody needs to archive this i guess

lites needs a mach, 3 or 4, and a bsd userspace

the parisc distribution is probably the most complete but also relatively useless

the intel bits are all over the place, spread out on multiple ftp servers, sites, etc., many of which are only available via archive.org

ugh
