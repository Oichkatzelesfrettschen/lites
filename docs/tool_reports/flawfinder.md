FINAL RESULTS:

core/sys4.c:131:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
core/sys4.c:144:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
core/sysent.c:28:  [5] (race) chmod:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchmod( ) instead.
core/sysent.c:29:  [5] (race) chown:
  This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files, a
  race condition results. (CWE-362). Use fchown( ) instead.
core/fio.c:139:  [4] (race) access:
  This usually indicates a security flaw. If an attacker can change anything
  along the path between the call to access() and the file's actual use
  (e.g., by moving files), the attacker can exploit the race condition
  (CWE-362/CWE-367!). Set up the correct permissions (e.g., using setuid())
  and try to open the file directly.

  maximum possible length.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
