# Technical Notes

The included PDF, `johannes_helander-unix_under_mach-the_lites_server.pdf`,
contains the master's thesis *Unix Under Mach â€“ The Lites Server*. It describes
Lites' architecture and how BSD was adapted to run on Mach. The PostScript
`lites.MASTERS.ps` is another format of the same document.

Building older releases often requires a matching Mach kernel. The Utah Flux
project hosted detailed instructions and patches, many of which are mirrored at
[archive.org](https://web.archive.org/).

To experiment with cross compilation or multiple architectures, see the
`setup.sh` script in the repository root. It installs a full toolchain and
qemu-based emulation targets.

The modernized sources in `src-lites-1.1-2025` require a compiler with full
C23 support. GCC 13 or Clang 17 (or newer) are known to work.
