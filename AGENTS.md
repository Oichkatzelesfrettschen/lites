All modifications must use modern idiomatic formatting and ensure code is well commented for Doxygen.
Any modified functions should include Doxygen-style block comments documenting purpose, parameters and return values.
Modifications must decompose complex logic into clear, flat structures where reasonable and adopt modern idioms.
Future contributions should further unroll and refactor existing code toward
modern paradigms wherever practical. Document functions using Doxygen comments
and prefer mathematically inspired clarity in naming and structure.
