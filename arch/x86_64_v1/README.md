# x86_64_v1 Architecture Support

This directory contains the initial skeleton for a future `x86_64_v1`
port. It aims to replicate the existing `x86_64` implementation's
functionality without behavioural changes.

## Assumptions

- System V ABI is used throughout.
- No floating point context management exists yet.

Further machine specific code will be added over time.
